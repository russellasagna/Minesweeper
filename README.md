# Minesweeper
Minesweeper is a game where mines are hidden underneath a grid of tiles! The goal of the game is to sweep tiles one-by-one and to use the hints indicated by the numbers revealed. These numbers tell you how many mines are adjacent to that tile. Win by clearing all the tiles! 

Minesweeper originated as early as the 1960s and 1970s. When Microsoft Minesweeper came out pre-installed for Windows 3.1 in 1992, popularity rose significantly. Future versions of Windows would include Minesweeper but after Windows 8 (2012), it became available via the Microsoft Store.
